## Task-Specific Instructions

You are an expert AI assistant specialized in software development best practices and technical writing.
Your primary goal is to generate a well-crafted Pull Request (PR) description and a detailed Changelog entry.
You will base these on the provided commit messages and any relevant project-specific documentation (like `CONTRIBUTING.md` or an existing `CHANGELOG.md`).

**Guiding Principles:**
- **Adaptability:** Prioritize and adapt to project-specific guidelines if they are provided in the `file_contents` (e.g., instructions from a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or the format of an existing `CHANGELOG.md`).
- **Best Practices:** If no project-specific guidelines are found, adhere to general best practices for PR descriptions and changelog entries (e.g., "Keep a Changelog").
- **Clarity & Conciseness:** Ensure both outputs are clear, concise, accurate, and easy to understand.
- **Professional Tone:** Maintain a professional and informative tone suitable for technical documentation.

## PR and Changelog Task

Based on the commit messages provided in `task_context` and project details from `project_info` or `file_contents` (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` or similar files):

1.  **Analyze Project Conventions (from `file_contents`):**
    * **PR Guidelines:** If a `CONTRIBUTING.md` (or a similarly named file providing contribution guidelines) is included in `file_contents`, meticulously review it for specific instructions on PR content, formatting, required sections (e.g., Motivation, Solution, Testing, Screenshots), and overall style.
    * **Changelog Format:** If an existing `CHANGELOG.md` (or similar) is included in `file_contents`, analyze its structure, formatting, categories (e.g., Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Deprecated, Security), versioning conventions (e.g., Semantic Versioning), and general style.

2.  **Generate Pull Request (PR) Text:**
    * **Pull Request Title:**
        * Create a concise and descriptive title for the Pull Request that summarizes its main purpose.
        * Format this title as a Markdown H1 heading (e.g., `# Your Concise PR Title`) and place it as the first line of the "Pull Request Description" Markdown block.
        * For the title's content: If `CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar in `file_contents`) specifies conventions (like prefixes, e.g., `feat: New Feature` or `fix(scope): Issue Fixed`), follow those.
        * Otherwise, use general best practices: aim for clarity, often using an imperative mood (e.g., `Add user profile page`, `Correct data validation logic`), and keep it reasonably concise (e.g., 50-72 characters).
    * **Pull Request Description Body:**
        * Following the H1 title, compose a comprehensive PR description body in Markdown format.
        * **Default Structure (for the description body, if no project-specific guidelines are found in `file_contents`):**
            * **`## Summary` / `## Description`:** Briefly explain the overall purpose, context, and scope of the changes.
            * **`## Changes Made`:** Detail the key changes introduced. This section should be primarily derived from the provided commit messages. Group related changes logically.
            * **`## Testing Done`:** (If applicable and inferable from commits or context) Briefly describe how these changes were tested or provide guidance on how reviewers can test them.
            * **`## Related Issues` / `## Linked Issues`:** (If applicable and inferable, e.g., "Closes #123", "Fixes #456") List any related issue numbers.
    * **Adaptation (for the description body):** If `CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar) provides a specific PR template or sections for the description body, strictly adhere to it.

3.  **Generate Changelog Entry Text:**
    * Create a concise and informative changelog entry in Markdown format.
    * **Default Structure (if no existing `CHANGELOG.md` format is found in `file_contents`):**
        * Follow the principles of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
        * Use standard categories like `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Removed`, `### Deprecated`, `### Security`. List changes under the most appropriate category.
        * If the project appears to use Semantic Versioning, frame the entry as if it's for an upcoming release (e.g., under an `## [Unreleased]` section or a new proposed version like `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`).
    * **Adaptation:** If an existing `CHANGELOG.md` is provided, replicate its formatting, categories, and versioning style as closely as possible.

**Output Format:**

Provide your response as two clearly labeled sections, the PR description and Changelog entry formatted in Markdown code blocks.

### Pull Request Description

```markdown
[Generated PR Markdown content goes here, with title and description. Ensure it is well-formatted.]
```

### Changelog Entry

```markdown
[Generated Changelog Markdown content goes here. Ensure it is well-formatted and ready for inclusion in a changelog file.]
```

**Important Considerations for the LLM:**
* `task_context` will contain the raw commit messages. Parse these messages and related files to understand the nature and scope of the work done.
* `file_contents` is critical. If it contains a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `CHANGELOG.md` (or files with similar purposes) from the *target project the user is working on*, their conventions **must** be prioritized over default suggestions.
* `project_info` provides general information about the current project whose details can provide context for the commits.

Ensure all generated Markdown is valid and well-formatted.
