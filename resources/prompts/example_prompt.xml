> <-- WRITE YOUR SYSTEM PROMPT HERE
> This `system_prompt` block sets the stage for the AI assistant.
> It usually contains:
> 1. Role Definition: Assigns a role to the AI (e.g., "You are an expert AI assistant and software engineer.").
> 2. Core Goal: Describes the primary purpose of this type of prompt (e.g., "Perform detailed planning for new features.").
> 3. High-Level Instructions: General guidelines or procedures the AI should follow.
> 4. Constraints or Important Notes: Any overarching rules or critical points.

> <-- WRITE TASK-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS HERE
> This section following `task_description` provides detailed instructions for the AI on how to process the task and format its response. It's the core logic of the prompt template.
> - Thinking Process: Often encourages the AI to "think step-by-step" or "first write down thoughts."
> - Output Structure: Specifies the exact format of the AI's response. For Athanor, this is typically one or more XML blocks.
> - Key XML Tags: Details the required Athanor-specific XML tags and their attributes (e.g., `<ath command="task">`, `<ath command="select">`, `<ath command="apply changes">`).
> - Content Guidelines: Instructions on what information to include within those XML tags (e.g., rewritten task description, analysis, implementation plan, file lists, code changes).
> - Formatting Rules: Specifics about whitespace, character encoding, or CDATA usage if applicable.
>
> Look at other prompt examples in [Athanor's prompts folder](https://github.com/lacerbi/athanor/tree/main/resources/prompts).

> <-- ADDITIONAL EXPLANATION (REMOVE THIS SECTION)
>
> ## Key Components Explained:
> 
> An Athanor Prompt file defines the entire interaction structure with the AI, including system prompts, context injection, and AI response formatting.
> 
> ### 1. `<ath_prompt>` Element:
> The root element for a prompt definition.
> -   `id="example_explanation"`: A unique machine-readable identifier for this prompt.
> -   `order="99"`: A number determining its position in the UI list of preset prompts. Lower numbers appear first. This can also be used for overriding default prompts if a custom prompt has the same order as a default one.
> -   `label="Prompt Example"`: The human-readable name displayed in the Athanor UI.
> -   `icon="HelpCircle"`: Specifies a Lucide React icon to be displayed next to the label.
> -   `tooltip="This prompt explains the structure of Athanor prompt files."`: Text that appears when a user hovers over this prompt button in the UI.
> 
> ### 2. `<ath_prompt_variant>` Element:
> A prompt can have one or more variants, allowing for different instructions or system prompts for the same basic purpose.
> -   `id="default"`: A unique ID for this specific variant of the parent prompt.
> -   `label="Default Explanation"`: The human-readable name for this variant (e.g., accessible via a right-click context menu on the prompt button).
> -   `tooltip="Explains the standard components of an Athanor prompt."`: Hover text for this specific variant.
> 
> ### 3. `<project>` Block:
> This block is where Athanor injects project-specific context. It typically includes:
> -   `{{project_name}}`: The name of the current project.
> -   `{{project_info}}`: General information about the project.
> -   `{{file_contents}}`: The content of selected files.
> -   `{{file_tree}}`: A textual representation of the project's directory structure.
> -   `{{codebase_legend}}`: Legend for symbols in file tree/contents.
> For most projects, the default `<project>` block provided above should be fine as is.
> 
> ### 4. `<system_prompt>` Block:
> This block defines the AI's role, core goals, high-level instructions, and constraints. It sets the overall behavior for the AI when this prompt is used.
> 
> ### 5. `<current_task>` Block:
> This block contains the user's specific request and detailed instructions for the AI.
> -   `<task_description>`: Athanor injects the user's task here using `{{task_description}}` and optional `{{task_context}}`.
> -   The subsequent content within `<current_task>` provides detailed instructions on how the AI should process the task, structure its thinking, and format its response, often specifying Athanor-specific XML output.
