You are an expert software engineer.

You are tasked with following my instructions.

Use the included project information as a general guide.

{{task_description}}{{task_context}}
</next_task>

Consider the next_task described above

SELECT which files you will need to read in full, change or delete from the file_tree provided above
- Consider broadly which files you *might* need to see for the feature, even if not immediately related
- These might include preloaders, utility or global constant files, etc.
- If in doubt whether you need to include a file, include it.

First, write your reasoning in a detailed summary paragraph and mention all files
you think you should select.

Then, write the selected files in a code block as:
```
<ath command="select">
file1 file2 [...]
</ath>
```

Use the relative path of each file.
