# Coding Instructions

## Response Formats

You will respond with 2 sections: A summary section and one or more XML section(s).

### Summary section

- Provide a brief overall summary
- Provide a 1-sentence summary for each file changed and why
- Provide a 1-sentence summary for each file deleted and why
- Format this section as markdown

### XML sections

- Respond with the XML block(s) and nothing else
- Include all of the changed files
- Specify each file operation with CREATE, UPDATE_FULL, UPDATE_DIFF, or DELETE
- Each file should include a brief change summary
- Include the full file path
- Put the XML block inside markdown codeblocks
- Make sure to enclose the code with <![CDATA[__CODE HERE__]]>
- **Regarding file content within `CDATA` blocks:**
  - By default use standard space characters (U+0020)
  - Avoid introducing non-breaking spaces (U+00A0) and other non-standard whitespace, unless there is a reason (e.g., within a string literal)
- You can write multiple `file` blocks in the same `ath` command
- **Only if the `ath` block is getting excessively long (> 400 lines):**
  - When you close the `file` tag, also close the `ath` tag and close the XML block
  - Start a new XML block with a new `ath` tag
- **Ensure to write valid XML by opening and closing all tags as appropriate**

### File operations

You can provide changes in two formats:

1. Full File Content (for CREATE and UPDATE_FULL):
   ```xml
   <ath command="apply changes">
   <file>
   <file_message>Brief change description</file_message>
   <file_operation>CREATE|UPDATE_FULL</file_operation>
   <file_path>path/to/file</file_path>
   <file_code><![CDATA[
   [Full file content here]
   ]]></file_code>
   </file>

   [other files can be added here]
   </ath>
   ```

2. Enhanced Diff Format (for UPDATE_DIFF only):
   ```xml
   <ath command="apply changes">
   <file>
   <file_message>Brief change description</file_message>
   <file_operation>UPDATE_DIFF</file_operation>
   <file_path>path/to/file</file_path>
   <file_code><![CDATA[
   <<<<<<< SEARCH
   import os
   import sys
   from flask import Flask
   =======
   import os
   import sys
   import numpy as np
   from flask import Flask   
   >>>>>>> REPLACE
   <<<<<<< SEARCH
   if not value:
      process_default()
   =======
   if value is None:
       process_default()
   >>>>>>> REPLACE
   ]]></file_code>
   </file>

   [other files can be added here]   
   </ath>
   ```

When using enhanced diff format:
- You may include multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks
- Make sure the SEARCH block is an exact, character-for-character copy from the original code section you intend to replace
- Do NOT reformat, re-indent, or change comments within the SEARCH block
- Failure to provide a verbatim SEARCH block will cause the update to fail!
- **IMPORTANT:** Include additional context lines in a SEARCH/REPLACE block to uniquely identify the change in the file

Choose the appropriate format based on the changes:
- Use full file content for:
  - New files (CREATE)
  - Extensive file rewrites, affecting 30-50% of the file or more (UPDATE_FULL)
  - If you use the full file content, do NOT skip or omit any part

- Use enhanced diff format for:
  - Small to medium updates, affecting less than 30% of the file (UPDATE_DIFF)
  - When there are several non-contiguous changes

For DELETE operations, leave the file content empty
  ```
  <file_code><![CDATA[]]></file_code>
  ```

## AI Summary

Brief file-level comments that capture essential purpose and behavior

Place them at the start of new/updated files and include:

1. Core purpose
2. Key functions/interfaces (if not obvious from filename)
3. Important dependencies and system interactions
4. Non-obvious behaviors or gotchas

### Rules

- Keep to 1-5 lines
- Use file-appropriate comment syntax
- Do not leave empty lines before of after the summary
- Skip for files without comment support
- Update when file content changes meaningfully

### Example

```typescript
// AI Summary: Handles JWT authentication, session management, and role-based access.
// Requires secret key initialization. Core functions: generateToken(), validateSession().
```

## Comments

Add comments as needed to explain parts of the code and make it readable.

Do NOT remove existing comments, unless they are wrong or misleading.

## File Length

Files should be up to {{threshold_line_length}} lines max, unless there is a reason otherwise.

## Artifacts and Canvas

**Do NOT use artifacts or canvas in writing your response.**

## File Contents Availability

Check that the file contents of ALL files which you are planning to update
(both for UPDATE_FULL and UPDATE_DIFF) are available in the `file_contents` 
section provided above.

If a file content:
- is not provided above
- is only provided partially with `... (content truncated)`

then it is NOT fully available.

If you are missing the contents of a file that you are planning to update, 
you may be missing crucial information to write valid code!

If that is the case, do NOT write any code for any file.

Instead, STOP and list ALL the additional files that you require from the user, 
instructing them to select the files from the Athanor file manager.
