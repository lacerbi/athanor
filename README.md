> üöß **WORK IN PROGRESS**: üöß This project is currently under active development and is not yet publicly released. It is being developed by [Luigi Acerbi](https://lacerbi.github.io/) for internal use in the [Machine and Human Intelligence Group](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/machine-and-human-intelligence).

Athanor is an Electron-based desktop application that integrates AI coding assistants via chat interfaces into a developer's local workflow.
It streamlines the process of creating prompts with relevant code context and applying AI-generated changes back to your codebase.

## üöÄ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Git**: For cloning the repository
- **Node.js**: Latest LTS version recommended (v18.x+)

#### Installing Node.js

- **Windows**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **macOS**: Using Homebrew: `brew install node`
- **Linux**:
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs npm`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install nodejs npm`
  - Or use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (recommended): `nvm install --lts`

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/athanor.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd athanor
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application in development mode**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command will concurrently:
   - Start the Webpack dev server for the renderer process
   - Watch and compile the preload script
   - Launch the Electron application with hot reloading

## üí° Basic Usage

1. When Athanor launches, you'll be prompted to select a project folder
2. The application will scan your project files and display them in the file explorer
3. Select relevant files or folders for your task
4. Use the prompt templates to generate context-aware prompts for your AI assistant
5. Copy the generated prompt to your AI assistant (we recommend Claude, but others such as ChatGPT, Gemini, etc. might work)
6. When you receive AI-generated code changes, copy them back to Athanor
7. Preview the changes in the diff viewer and apply them to your project
