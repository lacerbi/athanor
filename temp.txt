Let's remove the old Claude 3 models. We should have

- Claude 3.5 Haiku
- Claude 4 Sonnet
- Claude 4 Opus

Search online on the official Anthropic docs to find the stats and necessary info (e.g., exact model names and other properties) for the new models.

Remove the old models and add the new ones. You will need to do that in at least two places:
- the LLM module
- Athanor's LLM config json file
